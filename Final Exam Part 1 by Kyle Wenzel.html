<div class="title"> Defining 25 useful concepts | Kyle Wenzel</div>


<button class="collapsible">1. Provide answers for the following concepts: client-server application, socket programming, ip address, tcp port, http
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Client-server application:
    A client-server application is a software architecture where one computer (client) requests services or resources from another computer (server) over a network.
    In a client-server application, the server typically provides the resources or services, while the client requests and utilizes them.
    <br>Socket programming:
    Socket programming is a way for computers to communicate with each other over a network by using sockets, which are endpoints for communication.
    Socket programming allows developers to create client-server applications and transfer data between them using a variety of protocols.
    <br>IP address:
    An IP address is a numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet that uses the Internet Protocol to communicate.
    IP addresses are used to uniquely identify devices and facilitate communication between them on a network.
    <br>TCP port:
    A TCP port is a number used to identify a specific process to which data is sent when it is received by a device on a network.
    TCP ports are used by computers to establish connections and send data to specific services or applications running on other devices.
    <br>HTTP:
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data over the internet, most commonly used for accessing websites.
    HTTP operates on top of the TCP/IP protocol, and it defines how clients and servers should communicate with each other to exchange information such as web pages, images, videos, and other types of content.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">2. session and sessionStorage, localStorage, IndexedDB </button>
<div class="content">
  <p> sessionStorage:
    sessionStorage is a web storage API that allows web developers to store key-value pairs in a user's browser for the duration of a session.
    Data stored in sessionStorage is available only to the window or tab that created it, and it is deleted when the window or tab is closed.
    <br>localStorage:
    localStorage is a web storage API that allows web developers to store key-value pairs in a user's browser for an extended period of time.
    Data stored in localStorage is available across all windows and tabs and persists even after the browser is closed, making it useful for storing user preferences or other data.
    <br>IndexedDB:
    IndexedDB is a client-side web storage API that provides a powerful and flexible way to store and retrieve structured data in a user's browser.
    With IndexedDB, web developers can create object stores and indexes, and use advanced queries to efficiently retrieve data, making it ideal for building complex web applications that require offline data storage and synchronization.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">3. backbone, ember, underscore, bootstrap </button>
<div class="content">
	<p>Backbone:
    Backbone is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides a simple and flexible way to structure and organize client-side web applications.
    Backbone uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, allowing developers to separate concerns and easily maintain and extend their codebase.
    <br>Ember:
    Ember is a JavaScript framework for building ambitious web applications, with a focus on developer productivity and ease of use.
    Ember uses a convention-over-configuration approach, providing a set of defaults and conventions that help developers quickly build complex applications.
    <br>Underscore:
    Underscore is a utility library for JavaScript that provides a set of functional programming tools and helpers, such as iterators, arrays, and object manipulation methods.
    Underscore is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it easy to integrate into any JavaScript project.
    <br>Bootstrap:
    Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and tools for building responsive, mobile-first web pages and applications.
    Bootstrap includes a wide range of components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and modals, making it easy to build consistent and professional-looking interfaces.

  <p>Vanilla JS is plain JavaScript without any third-party libraries or frameworks, while jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX calls. jQuery UI is a collection of user interface widgets, effects, and themes built on top of jQuery, designed to make it easier to create complex UI components.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">19. Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Explain each of these three phases are about. </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The Mounting phase is when a component is initialized and inserted into the DOM for the first time, which involves calling its constructor, render() method, and componentDidMount() method. <br>The Updating phase occurs when a component's state or props change, which involves calling the render() method, componentDidUpdate() method, and shouldComponentUpdate() method to check if an update is needed. <br>The Unmounting phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM, which involves calling the componentWillUnmount() method.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">20. react Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features (such as  lifecycle methods). Briefly explain the purpose of each of the following hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRefuse, Reducer, useCallback useMemo.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>useState: The useState hook allows a function component to declare and use state variables, which can be updated and cause a re-render of the component when changed.

    <br>useEffect: The useEffect hook allows a function component to perform side effects (such as fetching data or updating the DOM) after rendering, by subscribing to state and props changes.
    
    <br>useContext: The useContext hook allows a function component to consume data and actions from a parent component's context (a global state or theme), without needing to pass down props manually.
    
    <br>useRef: The useRef hook allows a function component to access and modify a mutable value (such as an input field or a timer ID) across renders, without triggering a re-render.
    
    <br>useReducer: The useReducer hook allows a function component to manage complex state with a reducer function (similar to Redux), by dispatching actions that update the state based on the previous state and action type.
    
    <br>useCallback: The useCallback hook allows a function component to memoize (cache) a function instance, preventing it from being re-created on every render, and only changing when its dependencies change.
    
    <br>useMemo: The useMemo hook allows a function component to memoize (cache) the result of a function, preventing it from being re-computed on every render, and only changing when its dependencies change.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">21. React components, state, props, jsx, rxjs, virtual DOM</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>React components: They are like building blocks used to create the user interface of a web application, each encapsulating a piece of functionality that can be reused throughout the app.
    <br>State: It is an object that holds the data that can be changed by the component and the data can trigger a re-render of the component when it changes.
    <br>Props: They are the data that is passed from the parent component to the child component, and it helps in creating dynamic components that can be reused.
    <br>JSX: It is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manage complex UI elements.
    <br>RxJS: It is a library that allows us to write reactive programs by providing tools for working with asynchronous data streams.
    <br>Virtual DOM: It is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, used by React to optimize the rendering process. It helps to minimize the number of updates required by the real DOM, which makes the application faster.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">22. OAuth, short for "Open Authorization",  is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

What is the major difference between OAuth1 and Oauth2? https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/differences-between-oauth-1-2/</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The major difference between OAuth1 and OAuth2 is that OAuth1 relies on digital signatures to ensure message integrity and to prevent tampering, while OAuth2 relies on SSL/TLS for encryption and token-based authentication for message integrity and protection against tampering. Additionally, OAuth2 has a simplified flow, improved error handling, and better support for mobile devices.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">23. The difference between a framework and a library lies in a concept called "inversion of control". When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. Name two js libraries and two js framework respectively. </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Moment.js: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times in JavaScript.
    <br>Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript.
